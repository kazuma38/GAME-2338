# fallout 76 bugs

## 1. scraping bulk acid gives 15 acid but only takes 10 to make so by repeating this you can infanatly produce acid
### (White box) - balance testing
haveing somthing that gives more for deconstructiong it than makeing is is something that should have been notice when giveing the items a once over (my best guess at why its like this is some one accidently inputed the values in reverse so it would normaly take more to make than what u would get back as is the norm for this kind of game)

## 2. if you look at the ground while sprinting you move much faster than normal but the moment you look back up it returns to normal speed
### (Black box) - play testing
this isnt something that would normaly come up during normal testing so until players get ahold of the game and start doing wired things it probaly would never be noticed (who trys to run and tie thier shoes at the same time ill never know)
## 3. you can gain infinate caps by going to the mothman statue and picking up all the eggs in the area, then switch servers and repeat
### (Black box) - Balance testing
now this ones a bit tricky since this is probaly the case for a alot of items, since the items will exist on a per server baseis if one persone gets to a spot they could potentialy nab the items in question across the whole game asumeing another player didnt alrdy get it 1st before the player in question hoped to thier server ( best counter i can think to this is haveing a time penalty to swaping servers like once ur in one you cant swap out till X amount of time passes but this will also have its dimerits, or makeing spawn locations of items more random and posibly the spawn timers too)

## 4. when you quit the game while wearing power armor the fusion core inside will reste it self to fully charged when u log back in
### (white box) - functionality testing
im not im a fallout dev but im pretty sure fusion cores are 100% NOT suposed to do that. (game probaly doesnt know how to save a fusion core of a specific charge level since its counted as a seprate item from the power armor so it probaly only thinks "oh theres a fusion core" and not the specific charge level since whenever you find a fusion core out in the game by defult when u pick one up its at 100%)
## 5. in a hospital instance if you use the perk that lets you search medical bags for stimpack you can farm up an insane amount by constatly going in and out
### (Black Box) - balance, play, funtionality testing
now this is an interesting bug in that the istance isnt reset becuse after you clear the enemys they stay dead but the bags will reset thier flag that the perk has been used to search them ( i dont know if the perk only does it in only this instance or the world over but mostly likly becuse of how the open world works bags out side of instances will most likly stay searched but ones in instances will reset)
