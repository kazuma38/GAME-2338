## Review

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a RPG thats literaly just a computerized version of DnD(dungeons and dragons) that does all the dice rolls for you (literaly the game says flat out that the entire combat sytem runs on dice rolls and stat checks and there is a covient combat log to give you the play by play). it has a real time RPG combat that operates on rounds (wich pass every 5 seconds real time) with the ability to active pause (based on youre difficulty setting the might not be an option).

now when i say this is a computerized version of DnD i MEAN it, the amount of variables to test in this game are huge. just right out the gate there are 6 1/2 difficultys to choose from (the 1/2 is becuse one of the difficults is custom) and 3 of the difficultys reqiure a perfect understanding of pathfinder mechanics or you wont even make it throught the TUTURIAL (no im not jokeing if you half ass it you die, you also die if you are just unlucky so have fun!). and in true DnD fasion there are 8 races to choose from, 20 classes to choos from (6 of wich cant be initaly chosen due to pre-requestes need for them) and each of those 20 classes has 3 subclasses you can choose if you want a more specialized version of the class, aslo andy faith basied class has to choose from a literal TON of gods/goddess that cover alsorts of overlaping and individual domains, and most mage classes use a "bloodline" system (magic is hereditary aperently) thats as equaly diverse as picking a god or class. and here is the REAL kicker every time you level up you can either increse the level of youre current classes or you can gain a level in a copmpletely NEW class so the potential to make an abomintaion of a charater and screw your self is.....high (imagine picking both a mage class and a faith class thats ALOT of spell to keep trak of(FYI there is a class specialized in this EXACT setup)). the fact that thier are 5 pre-made defult characters, pre-buids for every class and subclass, and the abity to set auto leveling to you and youre party members(oh and they ALSO folow the same leveling rules). is a godsend to anyone who is a 1st timer or just bad at plaing charaters builds (i my self am both).

as far as balanceing the game is concered that would be the easiest and hard thing to do since this games sorce material is another game entierly that's only patches come in the form of hardback copies. since the game is trying to esentualy be its pen and paper counter part, by simply following the guide lines set down by the codex edition the devs are working with the game will be for the most part balanced (as balanced as DnD types can get anyway). and if too much is done in the name of balance then the game will get to far away from its own compliance ideals. aslo factoring in the players posible buid, the compsition of the party( and thier buid too), balanceing this game might require the words "good enogh" or a soulless army of undead workers (best exaple is the 1st main encounter after the tuturial while playing the normal dificulty becuse my player and party build wasnt ideal and i didnt sucefuly pass certian skill check that could have mad the encounter easier i was unable to handle the sear amount of enemies i had to fight and got floored several time till i reloaded a save far enogh back to alter my build more optomly and then just BARLY survive(also fun fact "normal" difficult has reduced enemy dmg and crit's are not as sever when directied twoards you and your party so ya)).

(and if youre wondering why the review only covers so little of the game thats becuse just getting through the character creation, and tutruial takes about 2-3 hours 2 of which are on just diciding your class and there are still magior functions of the game that havent been introcuded yet so unless i get 3-4 weeks to go over it this is what i can cover).
