## Review

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a RPG thats literaly just a computerized version of DnD(dungeons and dragons) that does all the dice rolls for you (literaly the game says flat out that the entire combat sytem runs on dice rolls and stat checks and there is a covient combat log to give you the play by play). it has a real time RPG combat that operates on rounds (wich pass every 5 seconds real time) with the ability to active pause (based on youre difficulty setting the might not be an option).

now when i say this is a computerized version of DnD i MEAN it, the amount of variables to test in this game are huge. just right out the gate there are 6 1/2 difficultys to choose from (the 1/2 is becuse one of the difficults is custom) and 3 of the difficultys reqiure a perfect understanding of pathfinder mechanics or you wont even make it throught the TUTURIAL (no im not jokeing if you half ass it you die, you also die if you are just unlucky so have fun!). and in true DnD fasion there are 8 races to choose from, 20 classes to choos from (6 of wich cant be initaly chosen due to pre-requestes need for them) and each of those 20 classes has 3 subclasses you can choose if you want a more specialized version of the class. and here is the REAL kicker every time you level up you can either increse the level of youre current classes or you can gain a level in a copmpletely NEW class so the potential to make an abomintaion of a charater and screw your self is.....high. the fact that thier are 5 pre-made defult characters, pre-buids for every class and subclass, and the abity to set auto leveling to you and youre party members(oh and they ALSO folow the same leveling rules). is a godsend to anyone who is a 1st timer or just bad at plaing charaters builds (i my self am both).
