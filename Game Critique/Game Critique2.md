## Review

Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a RPG thats literaly just a computerized version of DnD(dungeons and dragons) that does all the dice rolls for you (literaly the game says flat out that the entire combat sytem runs on dice rolls and stat checks and there is a covient combat log to give you the play by play). it has a real time RPG combat that operates on rounds (wich pass every 5 seconds real time) with the ability to active pause (based on youre difficulty setting the might not be an option).

now when i say this is a computerized version of DnD i MEAN it,
