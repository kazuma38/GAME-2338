## Review

Gundam Breaker 3 is a hack and slash game where you defeat enemy gundams and use their parts to create or customize you're very own gundam. since this game was origianly in japanese and the only version english speaking players can get is importing the SEA(south east asia) version there are alot of thing that need to be looked at.

at 1st glance balanceing they myriad of parts would be a nightmare but the actual peformace difenace between parts is mostly nonexistant, in a lot of cases the difrance between most weapons and parts is mainly visual but the avalible attack combos for weapons or in the case of parts the availbe optional equipment can vary between parts witch will need to be looked at. Now the main issue that ive seen in this game is that, since its a english translation of a japanese game there are quite a few localization issues mainly in the games "skills" being incorectly translated and also doesnt help that there is zero in depth explanations for what most skill actualy do. for instance there is a skill called "Adjustment(with out parts) X %" now for me (and from what ive seen on boards several people) i intialy thoght that this skill incresed your gundams abillitys(X being the modifying number) when you have missing parts, but in thruth this skill actually incresces the likelyhood of breaking off and enemies parts(HUGE revaltion for me when i found out had to rework alota my builds). another issue with skills is the "unique" skill witch for the most part wont actually tell you what they do untill you wait for at lest 1-5 minites for the text to transition into what they actually do ( an example being E-Carbon coating = durability + 20%). and once the transition happens unless you have memorized the skills position on the list its very easy to loose track of what it what. there is CO-OP multiplayer but due to the fack that this is an imported game that wanst entirely intended to be played in the US(and this was a game relesed back in 2016 so rather old on the gaming rotation) i wasnt able to find any one to test it out with but it is still something that must be looked into by teasters non the less.
