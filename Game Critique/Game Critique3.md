## Review

assasins creed ossesy is the newist in the serris and follows orgins in the departure from the original game play that is less about hideing in crowds and stabing people and jumping into hay piles, to a more RPG focus game... where you stab people and jump off mountians.

odyssy has three distinct play styles, assasin wich as the name implies is all about sneak attacks, warrior wich is strait forward combat, and hunter wich is long range attacks with a bow. all the gear in odessy give a passive percentage buff to a random one of the two skill paths. from a balance percpective its very difficult to not specialize in only one of the paths, if all your gear isnt focused in assasin it is unlikely u can take out even the weakest enemies your level in a single strike causeing them to alert others, if you dont focus your gear twoards hunter even a head shot at close range wont kill a grunt again casueing them to call for help, and if you dont focus warrior you wont be able to kill the enemies fast enogh before you get overwhelmed by thier numbers. it is some what possible to have a main focus and a sub or going half and half with the skill sets but trying to use all 3 at once will only make your life much harder. the difficulty setting on this game is extreamly strait forward, the harder it is set the more damage the enemy does this has be confirmed by other as to be the only effect so the only reason to crank the difficuly is if you want to reduce your margin for error it has no other effect on game play otherwise.

this game aslo has a faux version of the nemisis system from Middle earth: shadow of mordor in that it generates random enemy bounty hunters who try to kill you once your noteriety is high enogh as far as ive seen they always have two traits some times one of those traits is a wekness but normaly its two strenghts. the higher your wanted level is the more bounty hunters are after you as well as how much higher level they are than you, at one skull its only a single bonty hunter but at 3-4 skull its 3-4 bounty hunters and one of them is garanted to be at an extreamly difficult level at the full 5 one of them will be at skull level (wich if your not familiar with other games skull level means run and run faster). there is a max level of around 50 but i havent gotten there yet so i dont know if it will send hunters of over 50 to kill you if you raise your wanted level at that point.
