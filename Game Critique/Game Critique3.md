## Review

assasins creed ossesy is the newist in the serris and follows orgins in the departure from the original game play that is less about hideing in crowds and stabing people and jumping into hay piles, to a more RPG focus game... where you stab people and jump off mountians.

odyssy has three distinct play styles, assasin wich as the name implies is all about sneak attacks, warrior wich is strait forward combat, and hunter wich is long range attacks with a bow. all the gear in odessy give a passive percentage buff to a random one of the two skill paths. from a balance percpective its very difficult to not specialize in only one of the paths, if all your gear isnt focused in assasin it is unlikely u can take out even the weakest enemies your level in a single strike causeing them to alert others, if you dont focus your gear twoards hunter even a head shot at close range wont kill a grunt again casueing them to call for help, and if you dont focus warrior you wont be able to kill the enemies fast enogh before you get overwhelmed by thier numbers. it is some what possible to have a main focus and a sub or going half and half with the skill sets but trying to use all 3 at once will only make your life much harder. the difficulty setting on this game is extreamly strait forward, the harder it is set the more damage the enemy does this has be confirmed by other as to be the only effect so the only reason to crank the difficuly is if you want to reduce your margin for error it has no other effect on game play otherwise.
