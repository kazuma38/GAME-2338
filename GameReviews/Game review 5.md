* Type : colony sim
* platforms : PC


## Summary
rimworld is a colony management game similar to its predeasesor dwarf fortress in that you dont have 100% contoly over the people in your colony. each individual has thier own likes and dislike for actions they can do, some one would be a great builder but refuse to ever move materials, some one could be a great hunter but refuse to ever put out a fire (way more an issue then you would hope), and some one could be a great researcher but refuse to pick up a gun and fight (i call these people megasloth bait). people (or as what most players call them "pawns" becuse of the shape) do thier assinged duties based off the prioritys you give them and they will preform the actions on thier own(they dont always do what you want em to when you want em to do it so you have to adjust acordingly). this game also has a rather shocking anatomy system all vital organs and apendages can be damaged or lost and have various minor or major effects, lose and eye and a pawns aim with a gun becomes as bad as you would expect from a one eyed person lose both and they become 100% blind. lose an ear and nothing bad happens other than looking a little ugly (again a bigger problem than you would hope) but if a pawn loses a kiddey they the become much more vunerable to desease and infection (death from an infected wound cause from getting a bite from a fist fight caused by some one makeing fun of the fact that they are missing an ear is not a rare as you would expect). blood lose is also important not only are bleeding injeries more likely to become infected but the resulting blood loss can beome extreamly fatal depeing on the speed 1st a person will pass out from blood loss then they will die if medical treatment isnt administered and afterwards due to the varying amount of bloodloss a pawn will be weakend to a varying about depending on the amount of blood they are missing(and these effects apply to youre enemys and wilde life who you have to fight off while also missing limbs on youre side). there is also a choice of AI "storytellers" that monitor youre current status and adjust threats acordingly depeding on the story teller (one is litearly random so an end game threat could come at day one).

this game is also extreamly modable with a wide variety of mods from extra races other than humans, new weapons and armor, additional factions to ally or fight, new furneture or defensive enplacements, additional game functions, and even user created balance changes and difficulty modifires (currently playing with a mod that not only introduces dinosaurs but also lets you geneticly combine them with other animals my base is currently protected by an army of T-Rex chickens)

## Final Thoughts
* this is a game with a steep learning curve (after haveing 74 hours on the game still have alot of tricks to learn)

* something can and WILL go wrong (had a game over from my people getting attacked by a heard of elephants becuse i needed to hunt one for food everyone was then dead or incapaciteded shortly after, also when a mysterious stranger showed up to save the day..... he was swiftly gored to death)

* the actual goal of the game is to find/make a space ship and escape the planet but very few people actually rember to do it (mostly becuse survial require all of ones atention).
