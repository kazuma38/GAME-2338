## Details

* Game Title: Rougelands
* Type : rougelike RPG
* platforms : PC


## Summary
rouge lands is a pretty simple rougelike RPG where the goal is.......well know one not even the NPC's knows (im not kidding they will 100% tell you they have no idea what they are doing out here) but not dying is DEFFINATLY NOT the objective (but is very common, expected, and leads to a large amount of permenat unlocks) u play as a space cadet (this games equvalent to a star trek red shirt, high turn over rate).you start the game with only the basic weapon of your class (wich is dicided by the two stats you pick at caracter creation) and nothing else, when you die (and i mean when kuz not dieing is pretty hard to not do) everthing your charater is carrying is lost the exception being anything you manage to get in your storage chest in base before the inevitable (now you get to store stuff at every way station after a zone when game 1st came out way sations were only after ever 5 zones and only way to store items was to go back to ship and lose all youre progress, dam whimpy mellenials) crafting gear and consubales in this game is.... tricky and simple at the same time. any 10 of a matirial can be convered into a medal you need 3 difernt medals of the same tier to make anything and you have no idea at 1st what will even come out as at the start all recipes are unknown to you(even the order that you put them in affacts the outcome just swap the positions of 2 medals and a whole new item shows up). consumables are similar to medals but instead its 3 of a matiral and it only accapts spciffic types (bug, plant, monster parts). oh and etuning to ship doesnt heal you the only way to heal is to use a consumable no matter what (becuse why would a rougelike be nice).

## Final Thoughts
* this game is multi player (except on iron man mode becuse in multi a friend and rez you an infinate number of times)
* there is a learing curve but once you know the game it becomes much more easy (you can kill most of the 1st bosses solo with only the starting weapon at lvl 1 if you know what your doing)
* races and outfits are unlocked when u hit certian mile markers or get just plain lucky (one can just be bought in a certian shop if you find it)
